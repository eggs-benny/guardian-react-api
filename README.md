## <a name="description">Description</a>

This is a useful 1 page site built with React Hooks.

It leverages the Guardian's OpenPlatform API to fetch the most up-to-date Guardian headlines when you click the refresh button.

The website is intended to be used to refresh the feed of the most up-to-date articles, and also to search for specific types of articles too.

React was used to allow for easy container creation, allowing for the housing of articles within the feed, and the feed and search bar within the main app, making it easily amendable.

**Tech Stack:** *JavaScript, React, Node, CSS, Jest*

You can use the app [here](https://guardian-react-api.vercel.app/)

<!-- ```
As a busy news consumer
So I can quickly read through the essential of today's stories
I can see a summarised version of of the article 
```

To get a summary of an article's content, you'll need to use the [Aylien API
endpoint](https://docs.aylien.com/textapi/endpoints/#summarization), which means
integrating and calling another HTTP endpoint from a different API. This mean you'll need
to first fetch articles from the Guardian API, **then** use the Aylien API to summarise
the content â€” you'll need to use promises or callbacks to call both APIs and to handle the flow of
control. -->

## <a name="mockups">Mockups</a>

When the user first loads the app, they'll see two buttons and an empty feed:

<!-- <img src="https://github.com/BenSheridanEdwards/COVID-19_Tracker_React/blob/master/src/images/AppMockup-LineGraph.png" width="600" /> -->

Upon selecting 'refresh headlines', they'll see the 10 newest headlines in a scrollable inset feed. A similar feed will be shown, but only featuring searched-for items when 'search headlines' is clicked.

### <a name="features">Features</a>

- On visiting the [site](https://guardian-react-api.vercel.app/), start by clicking the 'refresh feed' button, which will generate the most up-to-date stories. You can repeat this action later to see if any new stories have been published.

- Alternatively you can type in a search query to see if the Guardian has any stories on this topic. For some (hopefully!) contrasting stories you could try 'Rishi Sunak' then 'Arsenal'.


### <a name="improvements">Improvements & Bugs</a>

#### Improvements

- Upon clicking the headline, instead of taking you off-site, add a React container that shows a summarisation of the article. Take user off-site if they click the image instead.
- Neaten up UX for mobile
- Align the news feed to the centre of the page
- Add gif functionality

#### Bugs

- No user feedback if search button is clicked without a search term, user may think the link is broken.
